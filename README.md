<h2>Hi, I'm Steve. Welcome to my Github profile </h2>



I am a developer, working full-time at Teamwork.com. I mostly work on frontend features around our Reporting, people, and Client focused areas of the platform. I also am responsible for migrating a range of legacy features to our modern codebase and I dabble in the backend where needed. I'm passionate about learning, training, creating solutions, and pairing up with others to work on something new. 

Most of my public repos are just temporary projects for learning, if you want to see what I've been working on the past few years, head over to [Teamwork.com](https://www.teamwork.com/product/reporting/) and check out the custom reporting, precanned reports, scheduled reporting, and the clients areas.
